/*You have started a dog walking business and you’d like
a program to keep track of the dogs you need to walk.
Write a Dog class. A Dog object should store a dog’s name,
the owner’s address, and some means of storing how many 
times a week, and on what days the dog should be walked.
One way of doing this is to have a 7-element array 
representing the days of the week. Each element would store 
the number of times the dog should be walked that day. 
So, if we decide the first day of the week is Monday, 
and a particular dog needs to be walked once on Mon, 
Tues, Thurs and Friday, twice on Wednesday, 
and not at the weekend, the array would store 
1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0.
OR perhaps you’d like to store this data in a different
way – it’s up to you.
Test your Dog class by creating an application called
DogManager to create Dog objects. Create some sample
Dog objects to represent some fictitious clients.
Add code to DogManager to print out your dog walking
schedule. So, it might display
Monday: Walk Molly 1 time. Address: 100 Main Street
Walk Nina 2 times. Address: 1234 Broad Street
Tuesday: Walk Duke 3 times. Address 300 2nd Street
….
Add methods to Dog to help you print out this data. 
Can you add code that prints a warning message if 
you have more than 6 dogs to walk in one day?*/
